# HEATLE

Heatle is a Wordle-Like game where a player has 6 guesses to get the correct word, exept with a twist! The only hint that the player gets after a wrong guess is how close the letter is to the correct one for that particular spot. Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind.

## To Run Locally:

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

`$> cd heatle $> npm install $> npm run start`
